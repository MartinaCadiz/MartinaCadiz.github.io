About me
----
I'm currently a Master's student in Data and AI Ethics at the University of Edinburgh, where I'm analyzing algorithmic transparency and responsible AI practices through a comparative lens between Chile and the EU's AI Act. At the same time, I'm part of a research team working on foundational models for astronomical time series (checkout our work [ here](https://www.stellardnn.org/projects/astromer/about.html)!). I know that these might seem like two very different worlds, but what connects them, and what really motivates me, is the goal of building machine learning systems that are reliable, trustworthy, and truly useful for the community.

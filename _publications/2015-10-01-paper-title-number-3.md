excerpt: 'Classifying variable stars is key for understanding stellar evolution and galactic dynamics. With the demands of large astronomical surveys, machine learning models, especially attention-based neural networks, have become the state-of-the-art. While achieving high accuracy is crucial, enhancing model interpretability and uncertainty estimation is equally important to ensure that insights are both reliable and comprehensible. We aim to enhance transformer-based models for classifying astronomical light curves by incorporating uncertainty estimation techniques to detect misclassified instances. We tested our methods on labeled datasets from MACHO, OGLE-III, and ATLAS, introducing a framework that significantly improves the reliability of automated classification for the next-generation surveys. We used Astromer, a transformer-based encoder designed for capturing representations of single-band light curves.'
